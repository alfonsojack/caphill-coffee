## Abstract:
Welcome to our Cap Hill Coffee Shops app! 

This app works in tandem with our backend database to create a directory of coffee shops in the Capitol Hill neighborhood of Denver, CO. At the home page, you can scroll through a list of coffee shops and select one to view details like their hours of operation, wheelchair accessibility, address, and more! Once youâ€™ve visited the coffee shop you can leave a rating on our website and help future users find the best coffee in Cap Hill.

## Context:
This is the second project of Mod 3 at Turing School of Software & Design. We were given ~1.5 weeks to create this project from scratch using a stretch technology new to us. Having little experience in building a back end, we relied on mentors, fellow students, and lots of documentation to be able to link our UI to the data we created. We probably spent 50-60 hours on this project over the time period given. This project is our first attempt at making a full-stack app, and we used many new technologies such as Express.js, Knex.js, and PostgreSQL.

## Learning Goals:

- Continue working with React fundamentals
- Test React components & asynchronous JS
- Test user flows using cypress e2e testing
- Create a multi-page UX using Router
- Create an app that retrieves info from and posts info to our created database
